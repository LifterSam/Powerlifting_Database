Hello,

this is the work of my Harvard "CS50â€™s Introduction to Databases with SQL" course. It contains an SQLite3 Database about powerlifting exercises, an entity relationship diagram, the database itself and a query file to fill and change the database with different values.

1. SQLite3_Design.md gives a brief markdown overview of the design choices and problems that occured with a video link inside for the contained video presentation.
2. SQLite3_schema.sql is the file for creating the initial database.
3. SQLite3_project.db is the database file itself.
4. SQLite3_queries.sql is the file for filling up and changing the contents of the initial database by queries.

The folder also contains the compressed MySQL version of the database (MySQL_Project_Lifting.sql, all in one file) and an UML file to show the links inside the database (MySQL_Project_Lifting_UML.mbw).

Best Regards
Thomas
