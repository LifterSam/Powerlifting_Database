Hello,

this is the work of my Harvard "CS50â€™s Introduction to Databases with SQL" course. It contains an SQLite3 Database about powerlifting exercises, an entity relationship diagram, the database itself and a query file to fill and change the database with different values.

I uploaded this to show my basic understanding of how SQL works. The folder also contains the MySQL version of the database and an UML file to show the links inside the database.
